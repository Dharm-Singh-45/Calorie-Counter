# Calorie Counter App

A simple web application to track your daily food intake and calories. This app allows you to log your meals, view a daily summary of your calorie intake, and delete any food entries. It uses **React** for the frontend and stores the data in the browser's **Local Storage** for persistence, ensuring that your data remains even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- Add new food entries with details such as food name, calories, and meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner, or snack).
- View the daily summary of calories consumed.
- Delete food entries from the daily log.
- Data is persisted in **Local Storage** so that it remains intact even after page refreshes.

## Tech Stack

- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Lucide Icons**: For displaying icons such as the utensils and calendar icons.
